# Brain Like computation mini-project: Predicting IT neuron activity
NX-414 Brain-like computation and intelligence, EPFL

This project aims to explore different approaches and models to predict neural responses from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex and visual stimulus shown during a 
object recognition task on monkeys. 

## Dataset
The data used are from the paper of Majaj, Hong et al. Weighted Sums of IT Firing Rates Predict Recognition Performance. It consists of recording from multielectrode arrays implanted in the IT cortex of monkeys (168 neurons),
alongside images of objects set against a natural landscape background (RGB channels, $24\times224$ pixels).}

## Requirment
- Python >= 3.5
- numpy
- pytorch
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- optuna
